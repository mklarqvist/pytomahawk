# pytomahawk

This package provides native Python3-bindings for interfacing with
[Tomahawk](https://github.com/mklarqvist/tomahawk/) libraries and provides
additional graphical functionality. This means exposing most of the features and
flexibility of the C++ API while not sacrificing the usability that Python provides.
